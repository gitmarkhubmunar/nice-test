				<p>The genesis and journey of Plastiki and its courageous crew will surely enter the annals of maritime history as one of courage and determination.</p>

				<p> Sailing and catamaran 8,000 nautical miles across the Pacific is no mean feat&mdash;but to do its floating on 12,500 plastic bottles glued together with adhesive derived from sugar and cashew nuts makes the voyage doubly remarkable.</p>

				<p> But without a doubt, David de Rothschild and his team's lasting legacy will be the global attention they have put on the menace to the world's seas and oceans from humanity's currently wasteful ways.</p>

				<p> Despite some successes, such as a decline in radioactive materials and persistent
				organic pollutants in parts of the Atlantic, the marine environment continues to be all
				too often treated as a dustbin.</p>

				<p> Plastiki has highlighted the threats from plastics, perhaps the most visible symbol
				of this unsustainable past and ongoing present.</p>

				<p> The North Pacific Gyre concentrates 3.5 million tons of discarded plastic&mdash;one of five such swirling waste patches in the world.</p>

				<p> Plastiki has helped to focus the minds of global public on the way contemporary economies all too often squander and mismanage finite and fragile natural resources.</p>

				<p> There is, however, another side to Plastiki story: the change possible through human  ingenuity, resourcefulness, and ambition to meet challenges head on.</p>

				<p> We are delighted to have been involved in this remarkable story. It was, in David's own words, inspired by UNEP report on marine litter from 2006–living proof that united's nations reports can make a difference.</p>

				<p> A staff member was present at the launch in San Francisco and again as a catamaran entered Sydney Harbour in triumph with UNEP's blue flag fluttering from the foremast.</p>

				<p> I and many other staff members were also there in spirit through the crew's blogs, which were often gripping and witty – essential daily reading. Plastiki delivered a metaphorical message in a bottle to millions upon millions of people.</p>

				<p> UNEP will also be there in the future, supporting Plastiki extraordinary legacy, taking forward our ongoing work assessing trends in the marine environment, and assisting governments toward the actions so urgently needed.</p>
